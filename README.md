This project is a Spring Boot–based REST API for managing members, secured using JWT authentication and role-based access control. It uses PostgreSQL with Spring Data JPA and Flyway for database migrations, supports pagination, sorting, filtering, and in-memory caching for improved performance, and enforces strict access rules where ADMIN users can perform full CRUD operations while USER roles have read-only access. The application is built with Gradle, includes comprehensive unit and integration tests with over 80% code coverage using JUnit, Mockito, and JaCoCo, and follows clean Git workflow practices with feature branches, meaningful commits, and pull requests to ensure code quality and maintainability.
